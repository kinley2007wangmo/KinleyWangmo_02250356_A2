##  Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Searching and Sorting algorithms for Practical Assignment 2.  
Two Python programs are included:  
- **Part A:** Linear Search & Binary Search  
- **Part B:** Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort  

Both programs are menu-driven and handle predefined datasets of student IDs, test scores, names, and book prices.

##  Part A – Searching Algorithms
### Implemented:
-  **Linear Search** (works on unsorted list of Student IDs)
-  **Binary Search** (works on sorted list of scores)

### How to run:

##  Part B – Sorting Algorithms
### Implemented:
-  **Bubble Sort** (Student Names)
-  **Insertion Sort** (Test Scores + displays Top 5)
-  **Quick Sort** (Book Prices + shows number of recursive calls)

### How to run:
